# React Native App - Coffee App

With help of this boilerplate you could have a brand new React Native App with TypeScript, Ionicons and React Navigation for an easy start

### Install the dependencies

yarn install

### To run ios app (Only works if you have a mac)

Install pods

cd ios && pod install

return to the root folder

cd ..

run the project

npx react-native run-ios

And the emulator should open, and you could start to code!

### To run android app (you will need to have android studio open with an emulator created)

run metro

npx react-native start

run the project

npx react-native run-android

And the emulator should open, and you could start to code!
